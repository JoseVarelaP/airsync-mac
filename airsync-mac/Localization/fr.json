Think of it as a little donation to keep this project alive and evolving.\nThat said, I know not everyone who wants the full experience can afford it. If that‚Äôs you, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. üòä\n\nThe source code is available on GitHub, and you're more than welcome to build with all Plus features free ‚Äî for personal use which also opens for contributions which is a win-win!.\nAs a thank-you for supporting the app, AirSync+ unlocks some nice extras: media controls, synced widgets, low battery alerts, wireless ADB, and more to come as I keep adding new features.\n\nEnjoy the app!\n(„Å£‚óï‚Äø‚óï)„Å£",
